# CCLT

CCLT is a program that help the user to easily 

This application is designed for solving a real-life problem in chemical industry, which is getting a certain amount of mixture of a certain density by mixing the available Materials of different density. A detailed description of this problem as follows:

Supposing we have n different materials available (M1, M2, ..., Mi, ..., Mn), the units and density of which are Ui and Di where i represent the index of the material, now we want to take a certain units of each materials (ui) and mix them into m units of mixture of density between u (the lowest acceptable density) and Î· (the highest acceptable density), which can be represented as formula:
