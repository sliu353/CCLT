# CCLT

CCLT is a program that help the user to easily 

This application is designed for solving a real-life problem in chemical industry, which is getting a certain amount of mixture of a certain density by mixing the available Materials of different density. A detailed description of mixing three materials is as follows:

Supposing we have three different materials, a units of material A, b units of material B and c units of material C, the density of which are α, β and χ respectively, Now we want to take a certain units of each materials and mix them into m units of mixture of density between λ (the lowest acceptable density) and η (the highest acceptable density).
